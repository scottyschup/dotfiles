# Setup
These are the directory and file the script will live in; feel free to change
these as needed to fit your environment
```sh
camgen_root_dir="$HOME/.curlcmanv2"
camgen_script="$camgen_root_dir/generate-campaign"
mkdir -p $camgen_root_dir
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scottyschup/dotfiles/main/scripts/generate-campaign" > $camgen_script
chmod +x $camgen_script
```

This adds the campaign generator dir to your path so you can run it with `generate-campaign` rather
than having to type `~/.curlcmanv2/generate-campaign` each time

Change the path/name for your `.zshrc` if it's not in your home dir, it's named something else,
or you use a different shell
```
echo "export PATH=$camgen_root_dir"':$PATH' >> $HOME/.zshrc
```
