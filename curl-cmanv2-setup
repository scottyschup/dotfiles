# Setup (for Mac)
These are the directory and file the script will live in; feel free to change
these as needed to fit your environment
```sh
curlcmanv2_root_dir="$HOME/.curlcmanv2"
curlcmanv2_script="$curlcmanv2_root_dir/curl-cmanv2"
mkdir -p $curlcmanv2_root_dir
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scottyschup/dotfiles/main/scripts/curl-cmanv2" > $curlcmanv2_script
chmod +x $curlcmanv2_script
```

The following adds the campaign generator dir to your path so you can run it with `curl-cmanv2`
rather than having to type `~/.curlcmanv2/curl-cmanv2` each time:

Change the path/name for your `.zshrc` if it's not in your home dir, it's named something else, or
you use a different shell
```
echo "export PATH=$curlcmanv2_root_dir"':$PATH' >> $HOME/.zshrc
```
