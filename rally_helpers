# Setup (for Mac)
## `curl-cmanv2`
These are the directory and file the script will live in; feel free to change these as needed to fit your environment:
```sh
curlcmanv2_root_dir="$HOME/.curlcmanv2"
curlcmanv2_script="$curlcmanv2_root_dir/curl-cmanv2"
mkdir -p $curlcmanv2_root_dir
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scottyschup/dotfiles/main/scripts/curl-cmanv2" > $curlcmanv2_script
chmod +x $curlcmanv2_script
```

## `token-fridge`
This needs the `curl-cmanv2` script from this same `scripts` directory to work (see above).
```sh
token_fridge_script="$curlcmanv2_root_dir/token-fridge"
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scottyschup/dotfiles/main/scripts/token-fridge" > $token_fridge_script
chmod +x $token_fridge_script
```

## Final steps
The following adds the campaign generator dir to your path so you can run it with `curl-cmanv2`
rather than having to type `~/.curlcmanv2/curl-cmanv2` each time:

Change the path/name for your `.zshrc` if it's not in your home dir, it's named something else, or
you use a different shell
```
echo "export PATH=$curlcmanv2_root_dir"':$PATH' >> $HOME/.zshrc
```

# Usage
Run each command with the `-h` flag for usage help.
```sh
curl-cmanv2 -h
token-fridge -h
```
